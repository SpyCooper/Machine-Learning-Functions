# Machine-Learning-Functions
Functions that I made that cover machine learning topics to better understand how they work


## Description

A passion project of recreating machine learning functions to use for anything I wanted to. I started this to understand more about machine learning algorithms from SKLearn I learned about in one of my classes.

Only the functions that have proper function documentation with descriptions, parameters, and return values are fully working properly.

## Folder Structure

The `Test-Datasets` folder are datasets I've found and used to test that functions work properly.

## Execution

In theory, you can import any of these into any python program and it should work.

I run them using `python3` in WSL to test the functions with the testing data sets.

## Credits

The data sets are not my own. They are used for testing purposes only.
